# azad

Game-playing ANNs that use a stumbler-strategist architecture. 

We focus on co-operative AI. Our ANNs try and help people, not outcompete them.

In Ian Banks delightful book, *The Player of Games*, the master game player Jernau Morat Gurgeh travels to Azad to play the game Azad, a challenging game that takes a lifetime to master. Azad is as much a statement of philosphy as it is of winning and strategy. In the book, Gurgeh comes from an alien culture so his philosophy and play is quite different than his opponents. We find this a fitting basis to start.

We come at ANN desgin as scientists, and humanists. Meaning we take three strong philosophical positions:

1. To win in the long-term science--psychology, neuroscience, and biology--must directly inform ANN desgin. 
2. ANNs should help people, not replace them.
3. An ANN must always be able to explain itself to a person, but of course it doesn't need to solve the problem the same way a person might. Put another way, to win in the long-term ANNs must serve science.
