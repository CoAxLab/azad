# Key points

1. The stumbler-strategist and the usefulness of weak human given heuristics in generalization. Our stumbler teaches a second network, which in time learns to transform the task into supervised learning. In its Deep Form the strategist learns not just the diagonals, but phi itself.

Improves on Raghu et al (2018) by:

1. Stimulus and game generalization (they 'generalize' to sub-optimal opponents).
2. The overall generality/usefulness of the stumbler-strategist, and heuristics.


# Text/figure improvemnents

- Rewrite into stumbler-strategist form
- Rewrite the Wythoff game -- shorten
- Fix readability of Algorithm figs -- shorten
- Better strategy/game figure (current Fig 2.)
- Re-run Fig 5 many times to get error bars; make axis clearer.
- Re-run Fig 6 for error bars.
- Redo Fig 7 design to get rid of serial game effects
- Add Figs for controls (below).
- Add new experiment Figs? (below).
